			<div id='descrr'>
			ALF is an alien from the planet Melmac who follows a ham radio signal to Earth and crash-lands into the garage of the Tanners. 
			The Tanners are a suburban middle-class family in the San Fernando Valley area of California.
			The family consists of social worker Willie (Max Wright), his wife Kate (Anne Schedeen),
			their teenage daughter Lynn (Andrea Elson), younger son Brian (Benji Gregory), and their cat Lucky.
			
			Unsure what to do, the Tanners take ALF into their home and hide him from the Alien Task Force 
			(a part of the U.S. military that specializes in aliens) and their nosy neighbors Trevor and Raquel Ochmonek 
			(John LaMotta and Liz Sheridan), until he can repair his spacecraft. He generally hides in the kitchen. It is 
			eventually revealed that ALF's home planet Melmac exploded because of a catastrophe involving a nuclear war. 
			In the Season One episode "Pennsylvania 6-5000", ALF tries to convince the President of the United States 
			to stop the nuclear program, as ALF fears that Earth might suffer a fate similar to Melmac's, though 
			miscalculating his words causes the President and National Security to call the FBI to arrest Willie. 
			ALF was off the planet when it was destroyed because he was part of the Melmac Orbit Guard. ALF (a.k.a. Gordon Shumway) 
			is homeless, but he is not the last survivor of his species. He becomes a permanent member of the family, although his 
			culture shock, survivor guilt, general boredom, despair, and loneliness frequently cause difficulty for the Tanners. 
			Despite the problems and inconveniences his presence brings into their lives, they grow to love him, though some episodes
			make it clear they are also afraid of how their lives would be turned upside down if word that he has been living with them
			gets out.

			<div id='descrr'>
			The first season introduces Dexter Morgan, a forensic blood spatter analyst for the 
			Miami Metro Police Department.Dexter is also a serial murderer who targets only 
			other killers. How he came to be a serial killer and develop his unique Code of 
			morality is revealed in flashbacks throughout the episodes. At a young age, an orphaned
			Dexter is found by police officer Harry Morgan, who adopts the boy. How he lost his parents
			is a traumatic memory he represses. When Dexter's adopted sister and Harry's daughter Debra 
			ask about Dexter's real parents, Harry only says that they died in a tragic accident. At an
			early age, Dexter begins killing animals and showing signs that he doesn't emotionally connect
			with people. Seeing that the boy's homicidal tendencies are rising and can't be fully quelled, 
			Harry decides to help the boy channel them. Harry teaches Dexter how to hide his actions from 
			police investigations and that if he must kill then it should only be murderers who are escaping 
			the law. Dexter comes to refer to these guidelines as "The Code" or "Harry's Code" - Rule 1 is 
			to never be caught, Rule 2 is to only kill those whom he knows without a doubt are killers. 
			Harry's daughter Debra is unaware of her adopted brother's true nature and doesn't know why her 
			father spends so much time with him on "hunting trips." Harry puts off Dexter killing an actual
			person for as long as possible, but finally gives his adopted son permission to do so when he is
			in the hospital and realizes his nurse has been killing patients. In season 7, Dexter clarifies 
			that he is 20 years old when he first kills a human being. Harry dies in a hospital a year 
			later, from heart difficulties.
